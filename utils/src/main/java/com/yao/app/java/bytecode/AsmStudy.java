/**
 * 描述:
 * Java bytecode libraries:
 *
 * 1. ASM is fast and actively developed.
 * 2. BCEL is comparatively slow. XXX
 * 3. Javassist is probably easiest to get started with if you're not familiar with Java bytecode.
 * 4. Cglib builds on top of ASM, providing some higher level abstractions.
 * 5. Byte Buddy generates classes via a DSL. Actively maintained and seeing increasing usage.
